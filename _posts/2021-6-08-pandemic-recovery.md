## INTRO
{: .text-center}
Like most, it was a really tough 2020 and into 2021 on myself and my family. This was made especially difficult because of my anxiety and the other stressors from changing jobs, being at home 24x7 and all the events that have happened in the last 18 months or so. It's also important to understand my particualar type of anxiety, Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The things I have done are targted at this specific type. Your type will probably be different in terms of coping mechanisms and such. It goes without saying, but I'm obviously not a medical professional. None of what you'll read here is medical advice but rather an exposition on my personal experiences and things that have worked to help me and my family. Before you do anything, talk to your doctor, your therapist (if you don't have one, get one), your spouse, your family and/or your friends.

## THOUGHTS AND IDEAS 
{: .text-center}
1. Diet and Exercise
    * You are what you eat
        
        This is quite possibly the most important thing you can do for yourself and your psyche. Explore several types of "diets" and see what your body likes and talk to your healthcare professional. My doctor recommended the Mediterranian diet for me but my body really loves a Keto diet. My wife, on the other hand, needs an Auto-Immune diet. Not only does your body get what it needs but the mere knowledge that you're on a healthy path will improve your mood.

     * Get off your butt and move
        
        The other part of this is moving. Simple exercise. I'm not the best at this and you'll find literally thousands of pages of studies on what is really beneficial. But, given all that, getting outdoors and taking a walk, spending time in nature or just spending time out of your house doing 'something' is way better than nothing at all. Not only does this help you physically but the quickest way to combat anxiety is to exercise and burn off that excess adrenaline that you've built up. Exercise also increases endorphines that make you happy.

2. Sleep

3. Human contact

4. Music and Mindfulness

5. Understand your anxiety
