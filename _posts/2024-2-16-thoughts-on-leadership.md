## ABOUT
{: .text-center}
I was recently at my dad's house cleaning out my old closet reliving past memories as I came across various trinkets and things until I stumbled upon my 3 pages of notes from Drum Major Camp. I thought to myself before I started reading, oh this will be good and chuckled at little. Then I began to read... I was absolutely blown away! I have thought most of my career that the perceptions and ideas around leadership have just developed out of nothing along my travels, however, I know now that I was wrong. Aside from the example of my father and mother, I now know where much of how I think about leadership has come about. I would like to share it with you here. It's pretty neat.
