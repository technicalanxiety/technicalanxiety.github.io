## ABOUT
{: .text-center}
I was recently at my dad's house cleaning out my old closet reliving past memories as I came across various trinkets and things until I stumbled upon my 3 pages of notes from Drum Major Camp. I thought to myself before I started reading, oh this will be good and chuckled at little. Then I began to read... I was absolutely blown away! I have thought most of my career that the perceptions and ideas around leadership have just developed out of nothing along my travels, however, I know now that I was wrong. Aside from the example of my father and mother, I now know where much of how I think about leadership has come about. I would like to share it with you here. It's pretty neat.

    As you read through this, think about how these thoughts and concepts might 
    apply to pretty much any organization or situation.

3. You're only worth what you give away
4. You can only give away what you have


Inspiration or Enthusiasm/Excitement? Inspiration fosters competition, cooperation and creation. Enthusiasm/Excitement fosters feelings of superiority and 'show-offs'. Enthusiasm is from the greek 'en theos' or 'in the presence of the divine'. We must not strive for enthusiasm but for inspiration.

Discipline to a follower is 90% attitude and 10% skill. Several leadership traits to encourage discipline, knowledgeable, charismatic, fearless, supportive, listener, unselfish. Some leadership traits that

Breaking out of your comfort zone. The safest thing to do with your band is to do those that you are most comfortable with. Leaders must take chances and risks *at the right time* to widen your confort zone.

Establishing a relationship with your superiors is crucial, be adaptable and flexible.

**Don't wait to be told what to do, take charge**
