## PURPOSE
{: .text-center}
This post is coming real soon! I wanted to get this out there so that I wouldn't forget what I wanted to write about. A little backstory. I was collaborating with a Kubernetes Master collegue of mine ([Peter Grace](https://twitter.com/petergrace), super awesome dude) and he was just not diggin' Log Analytics. What ended up happening, he just wasn't happy with how you reviewed logs in the log workspace. I gave him some ideas but it occurs to me that there are those out there that may feel the same. What I'm going to do with this post is go through how to use Log Analytics to view log data. Actually view log data, not just use it for performance monitoring but actually a log aggregation tool. I'll put something on LinkedIn and Twitter when the final copy is pushed. Thanks!
