So I'm still deciding on an overall Jekyll theme and there will be content soon.

**Update 2021-06-08**
So I found the theme I'm using and made a few modifications to suit. I plan to change the theme soon to something else that's a bit easier to read. My current theme is from [Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko). Some pretty nice themes there.
