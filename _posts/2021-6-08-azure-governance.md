## PURPOSE
{: .text-center}
I've been asked to write up something on Azure Governance. A little background on why. A asked a colleague of mine to give me a topic to write about to share. He mentioned a particular client and how they were well versed in Azure but didn't understand at all the idea of Governance and why it's so critical. I'll be adding some content here around Governance and why it's important. There will be lots of words and not a lot of visuals unfortunately :)
